## GitHub Actions

_GitHub Actions should already be configured: this section is for reference only._

The following repository secrets must be set on [GitHub Actions]:

- `GH_USER`: The GitHub user's username to pull and push containers.
- `GH_TOKEN`: A personal access token that can trigger workflows.
- `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`: The GitHub user's [GPG private key].
- `GPG_PASSPHRASE`: The GitHub user's GPG passphrase.

These must be set manually.

### Secrets for Optional GitHub Actions

The version and format GitHub actions
require a user with write access to the repository,
including access to trigger workflows.
Set these additional secrets to enable the action:

- `GH_USER`: The GitHub user's username.
- `GH_TOKEN`: A personal access token for the user.
- `GIT_USER_NAME`: The GitHub user's real name.
- `GIT_USER_EMAIL`: The GitHub user's email.
